2010-07-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CardDAVDirectoryFactory.js:
	(CardDAVDirectoryFactory.getDirectories): updated method to use
	the abmanager rather than the rdf service.

2010-07-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: (CalDAVAclManager._appendIdentity):
	the "newIdentity" pushed in the array would keep its null value
	because it would not be redefined properly (double use of "let" in
	the conditional block).

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js:
	(InsertCardData): ignore properties with a value of "undefined" to
	avoid an exception during conversion.

2010-07-16  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js
	(_insertCardMethods.email): assign the "home" emails as the
	secondary email.

2010-07-01  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js
	We not only consider the "PREF" parameter when setting
	the primary email but also the "WORK" value.
	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js
	in the adr function, we correctly consider the "extended"
	address attribute by using index 1 and not 0
	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js
	in the tel function, we now overwrite the fax number only
	if it's a WORK fax or if the value isn't already set
	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js
	in the card2vcard function, we correctly set the pobox
	attribute (to none) instead of setting the street address
	geographical attribute to none

2010-07-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: (_parseCalendarUserAddressSet): fixed
	invocation getElementsByTagNameNS by using the
	"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" namespace without braces...

2010-06-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/folder-handling.js:
	adapted to make use of the new nsIAbManager API.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/cardedit-overlay-common.js:
	removed the reference to "gSynchIsRunning", which has been made
	useless a long time ago.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js:
	(list2vlist): the "list" argument is now passed as a nsIAbCard.
	(card2vcard): adapted to make use of getAttribute.
	(importFromVcard): no longer take the "customFields" argument, as
	it's no longer needed thanks to the new nsIAbCard API.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/contactspanel-overlay.js:
	temporarily disabled.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/autocomplete-common.js:
	renamed to messengercompose-overlay.js.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	make use of the new API provided by nsIAbDirectory and nsIAbCard.
	The latter obsoletes the SOGoConnectorVolatileABCard
	implementation.

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: adapted code to new interfaces. We now
	make use of getElementsByTagNameNS where we used to use
	getElementsByTagName. Otherwise, most elements would not be found.

	* js/SOGoConnectorVolatileABCard.js: dropped obsolete class
	module.

	* js/CardDAVAutoCompleteSession.js: same as below.

	* js/CardDAVDirectory.js: renamed from abdavdirectory.js. Adapted
	code to new interfaces.

	* js/CardDAVDirectoryFactory.js: renamed from
	abdavdirectoryfactory.js
	(CardDAVDirectoryFactory.prototype.getDirectories:) remove useless
	exception handling.

	* chrome/content/inverse-library/sogoWebDAV.js: (sogoWebDAV:)
	added a new "synchronous" parameter for triggering synchronous
	requests. By default, this.synchronous is set to false, when not
	specified.
	(onXMLRequestReadyStateChange:) handle synchronous requests. The
	XMLHttpRequest implementation of Mozilla now triggers an exception
	when the request could not complete and "getAllResponseHeaders" is
	invoked. We now treat this exception as was already done with
	"status". We also check if the new ivar "requestXMLResponse" is
	set on the client so that we can return a proper XML response
	without needing for reparsing it in the callbacks.
	(sogoWebDAV.prototype.post:) we now explicitly set the
	content-type to appXXX/xml.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/webdav.inverse.ca.js:
	dropped file.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/webdav_lib/*.js: dropped
	all files, made useless by the changes in sogoWebDAV.js.

	* Initial TB3.1 code

2010-06-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/inverse-library/sogoWebDAV.js: added the
	"OPTIONS" operation.

2010-05-28  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/inverse-library/sogoWebDAV.js:
	(onXMLRequestReadyStateChange) we now attempt to deduce the
	content length from the response text when the "content-length"
	header is not present. This enables us to support the "chunked"
	transfer encoding.

2010-05-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* components/componentRegistry.js: disbabled
	""@inverse.ca/calendar/fburl-freebusy-provider;1" as it seems to
	cause a problem in certain configurations.

2010-04-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js
	(_insertCardMethods.tel): we no longer loop around the whole list
	of types. Instead we search for certain known types and try to
	popupate the card accordingly.
	(_insertCardMethods.adr): we privilege the "HOME" type when the
	"WORK" type is not specified.

2010-04-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js (_userAddressSetCallback): take
	identities with empty displayname into account. In JS, "" = false,
	therefore we need to test it against "null" to achieve this.

2010-03-24  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/calendar-event-dialog.xul
	We correctly overlay the menuitem for the "confidential" label

2010-03-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/inverse-library/sogoWebDAV.js
	(onXMLRequestReadyStateChange): we check the content-type for
	"text/xml" or "application/xml" return types before requesting the
	"responseXML" member of the request object. We also check for a
	content-length > 0. This avoids a "no content found" error with
	empty responses.

2010-03-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js (_initAccountMgr): it may happen that
	identities referenced in the account manager are ghost identities.
	We work-around this, at least for the moment, by explicitly
	removing those from the default account.

2010-02-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js (onDAVQueryComplete:) ensure that the
	returned entries exists in the cache before deleting them, to
	avoid an exception.

2010-01-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/skin/classic/sogo-connector/addressbook/addressbook.groupdav.overlay.css:
	added classes and icons from Mac and non-Mac platforms. (Closes: #51)

2010-01-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	fixed support for webdav-sync, which didn't take the intermediary
	"supported-report" element into account.
	Fixed a bug in the intepretation of the DAV resourcetype property.

2009-12-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js: ensure
	that the "type" parameter is available when reconstructing the
	array of types for the "TEL", "WORK", "URL" and "EMAIL" tags.

2009-08-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/calendar-common-sets.xul:
	added an "Export Task" menu item to the task context menu, that
	triggers the export of the selected tasks.

	* install.rdf: version number set to 0.97pre1

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/utils.js: slightly
	modified to override modifyEventWithDialog rather than openDialog.
	Fixed to take the recurrence state of the selected item into
	account.

2009-08-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/utils.js: if an item
	changes during a calendar refresh, we must fetch the new item from
	the calendar and bind it to the editing/summary dialog. Otherwise
	the old version is still used.

2009-08-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	modified to handle "valid-sync-token" synchronization errors.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/calendar-summary-dialog.xul:
	new version of the overlay, only for including utils.js and
	thereby have access to our version of isCalendarWritable.

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: we remove the entries pertaining to
	subitems when a refresh occurs on a calendar entry.

2009-08-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	*
	chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/calendar-summary-dialog.{js,xul}:
	removed overlays, modified code put back in Lightning (inverse edition).

2009-07-21  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js
	We now keep custom fields between roundtrips.
	See http://www.scalableogo.org/bugs/view.php?id=32

2009-07-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/utils.js: overriden
	"openDialog" to force a refresh of the item calendar before
	displaying the dialog IF the item is an invitation or is read-only.

2009-07-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	*
	chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/calendars-list-overlay.js:
	fixed an exception occuring when no calendar is selected.

	* chrome/content/inverse-library/sogoWebDAV.js: fixed a bug
	occuring in the XML to JSON converter when the parsed response is
	not flattened.

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: we trigger the
	"caldav-component-acl-loaded" or "caldav-component-acl-reset" to
	notify observers that the event entries are ready.

2009-07-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	*
	chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/calendar-event-dialog.xul:
	fix the privacy label of the privacy statusbar item.

2009-07-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/calendars-list-overlay.js:
	don't enable the "new items" buttons when the selected calendar is
	marked as read-only.

2009-07-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: we pass the url of the calendar as data
	argument on every request, for error management. For errors >= 498,
	we remove the entry but for errors > 399, we keep it and mark it
	as lacking ACL support.

2009-07-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: trigger a "caldav-acl-reset"
	notification where the status code returned by the server is >
	399. This enables listeners to take action when the request chain
	is aborted.

2009-07-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: trigger the "caldav-acl-loaded"
	notification only when the second address set is received.

2009-07-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	*chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/addressbook.groupdav.overlay.js,
	chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	save preferences as soon as a list has been modified to avoid
	duplication when a crash occurs.

2009-07-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	*
	chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	it may happen that we are returned a card we already have "as new"
	and with a different version number than the one we have. In and
	only in that case, we update the card/list so that we don't lose
	updates.
	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/preference.service.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	removed obsolete preferences

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js: we become a bit more foolprop when an
	XMLHttpRequest fails for a reason or another and delete the
	corresponding entry so that the request can happen again.

2009-06-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	*chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/preferences.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	removed "display synchronization dialog" from groupdav addressbook
	settings window.
	chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	fixed a bug where list downloads would tranmis the tag
	"vcard-download" instead of "list-download", preventing the
	downloaded lists from being created or updated.

2009-06-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	refactored code and added support for webdav sync spec.

2009-06-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/inverse-library/sogoWebDAV.js: modified to
	convert a result set returned as XML to a javascript structure of
	objects.

2009-06-10  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js: fixed the
	telephone attribute mapping.

2009-06-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/addressbook.groupdav.overlay.js:
	restored the ability to synchronize addressbook while the
	selection is currently in the results pane (right list).

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	refactored the code and added support for ctag-based synchronisation.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/preference.service.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	added methods for saving and retrieving the ctag of ab collections.

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/implementors.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	removed obsolete module.

2009-04-06  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Bumped version number to 0.93

2009-03-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/sync.addressbook.groupdav.js:
	reset the status of pending connections if an error occurs during
	a collection operation.

2009-03-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/addressbook.groupdav.overlay.js
	(deleteManager): we invoke "deleteDirectory" after
	deletedSelectedCards, to ensure the list is deleted properly.

2009-03-16  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/general/vcards.utils.js: properly
	decode fields with base64 encoding.
	Work-around a bug of qp encoders which fold lines without escaping
	their crlf.

2009-02-23  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Updated German translation. Patch from
	Alexander Greiner-Baer <sogo-algb@freenet.de>
	* Added Italian translation. Patch from
	Marco Lertora <marco.lertora@infoporto.it>

2009-01-13  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * js/CalDAVAclManager.js
	We now correctly handle the deletion of identities
	with the "caldav_*" key from the user's preferences. 
	We also correctly reinitialize our ivars prior
	to perform a refresh of the ACLs.

2008-12-19  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js
	Reidented the code. Also modified _appendIdentity()
	to NOT set any imip.identity to the corresponding
	calendar. This is not reliable and the code has
	been moved directly to getProperty() in
	calDavCalendar.js from Lightning.
	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/autocomplete-common.js
	We now override ComposeLoad() so that we correctly show
	the "comment" field even when we first compose a message
	See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227903.

2008-12-03  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>	

	* Added the possibility to refresh CalDAV ACLs
	* Removed the "supportsACLs" variable - we now
	entirely use hasAccessControl.

2008-11-28  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/calendar/calendars-list-overlay.js
	We now correctly enable the new task / event upon startup
	once the ACLs are loaded.
	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/lightning/messenger-overlay-sidebar.js
	Removed all the unused code. The whole overlay should be
	eventually removed.
	* js/CalDAVAclManager.js 
	We now force them imip.identity once the ACLs are loaded.
	* Bumped the version number to to.90pre22.

2008-11-26  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * js/CalDAVAclManager.js remove unnecessary calls
	to dump() and we now correctly set the identity
	of all calendars, even for those we don't own.
	* Bumped the version number to 0.90pre21

2008-11-24  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/edit-list-overlay.js
	We fallback to the messenger window if the ab window isn't available

2008-11-23  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>	

	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/lightning/lightning-calendar-properties-overlay.js
	We now correctly select the menupopup item (first one)
	* Bumped the version number to 0.90pre19

2008-11-16  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* /content/sogo-connector/addressbook/addressbook.groupdav.overlay.js
	Replaced calls to deleteCards() / deleteDirector() with
	deleteSelectedCards() to avoid refresh problems
	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/edit-list-overlay.js
	We really get the address book window before trying to perform
	a DAV operation.
