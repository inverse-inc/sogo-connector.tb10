	* /content/sogo-connector/addressbook/addressbook.groupdav.overlay.js
	Replaced calls to deleteCards() / deleteDirector() with
	deleteSelectedCards() to avoid refresh problems
	* chrome/content/sogo-connector/addressbook/edit-list-overlay.js
	We really get the address book window before trying to perform
	a DAV operation.
